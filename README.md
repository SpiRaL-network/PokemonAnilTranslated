IMPORTANT:

I do not make this game, nor the translation. 
I patch it quickly using Raizen v1.12 text and graphics to be able to play the last version of Pokémon Anil (v2.08) in English.

If the author or the translator wants me to deleted this repo, feel free to contact me. 

This version is using Pokémon Anil v1.12 (Rayzen) English texts and graphics.

A better translated version will be uploaded by Rayzen any time soon.

This version is only untended to let us play Pokémon Anil v2.0.8 before the official and supported release comes out.

KNOWN BUGS:
- For the random mod, the PNJ is invisible but you can still talk to him if you know where he's from the official 2.0.8 version.
- Some texts are not translated yet.
